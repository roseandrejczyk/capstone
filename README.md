      <p class="p1"> This project is for Capstone. I am enrolled in Capstone at
        Bacon Academy where we get to explore different career paths. I have
        networked and interviewed multiple people. I am interest in computer
        science and have narrowed down the vast amount of career options in this
        area to<em> Graphic Programming/ Developer. </em> I have always enjoyed
        video games/movies. </p>
      <h1 class="capstone"> About Me </h1>
      <p class="p1"> My project is going to be a website or a article about
        everything I've done this quarter. I started coding for just this month.
        I have liked writing, drawing, and entertainment; graphic development is
        all of those in one. This is the career feild that I want to pursue and
        will go to college for Computer Science. But, that doesn't mean that I'm
        not open to other feilds because there are multiple career paths.</p>
      <h2 class="h2"> People Networked With </h2>
      <p class="p3"> I always wanted to learn how to create a video game of my
        own. I like to draw and write stories; writing a book or participating
        in making a successful video game/ movie is one of the goals I have
        always had. I interviewed and questioned multiple people.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li> Meghan Lewis- works at Bloomberg</li>
        <li> Sarah Botwinick- works for Google</li>
        <li> Mr.Parson- Emailed Questions</li>
        <li> Brianna Cuadros- Emailed Questions</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="h3"> What I've Learned </h3>
      <p class="p3"> Websites and resources that I have used to learn
        coding/programming. This past month I have continually taught myself
        coding. I have been teaching myself HTML (Hyper Text Mark Up Langauge)
        which is how a website is made and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) creates
        the aesthetics. </p>
